# Scientific Computing
Lots of fun stuffs about Scientific Computing!

## Mini-Bio
Claudio Torres is a faculty member at [Department of Informatics](http://www.inf.utfsm.cl),
[UTFSM](http://www.usm.cl).

## What will this repo contain? 
All the jupyter notebooks of ``INF-285 Computación Científica``.

If you have any questions or suggestions, please send the to _claudio.torres_ at (@) _usm.cl_ .

# What is the purpose of this repo?
1. Share the code
2. Share the opportunity to **play** with what we are learning in the lectures
3. Get into the analysis of detailed examples
4. Learn to analyze how different algorithms and methods handle particular problems

Below, we show the list of main files related to each chapter on the classnotes and below that we have a list of **Bonus** files that complements the mains files.
All of them are interesting and **even easier to use** now with the CoLab link!

## List of bonus files.
- _Preliminary_
  - **The Beginning**: This jupyter notebook gives an **important** introduction to key libraries for the class, such as NumPy, Matplotlib, among other. [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tclaudioe/Scientific-Computing-V3/blob/main/Bonus%20-%20current/Bonus%20-%2000%20-%20The%20beginning.ipynb)
  - **List Comprehension vs NumPy**: Here we analyze the effects of writing code taking and not taking advantage of NumPy, and how slower the code gets when we don't take advantage of NumPy. This is **very very very important** in the class. [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tclaudioe/Scientific-Computing-V3/blob/main/Bonus%20-%20current/Bonus%20-%2000%20-%20List%20Comprehension%20vs%20NumPy.ipynb)
  - **Solving a system of linear equations**: A traditional first approach to solve a system of linear equations one thinks of is by computing the **forbidden** inverse of a matrix, i.e. $A^{-1}$. Here we show that this approach is an slow alternative, there are other issues but for now it is enough to know it is just slow.

  - Interesting examples to play with during the beginning of the semester:
      - **First lecture - linear transformation of an image**: Here we can observe how a linear transformation applied to an image works.
